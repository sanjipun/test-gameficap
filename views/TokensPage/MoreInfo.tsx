            Royal Protocol is the first piece of a digital ecosystem which combines blockchain
            technology with game development. By breaking down technological barriers, Royal
            Protocol allows players to access interactive digital entertainment while reaping
            financial rewards through a fully-integrated, intuitive gaming economy. This gives
            individuals high-quality games which double as a means of financial empowerment.

            Through this, Royal Protocol signifies a shift in how digital gaming content is created,
            distributed, recorded, adopted, and profited from. This project addresses finances,
            technology, community, risk, income, and accessibility. Additionally, Royal Protocol has
            the Royal Protocol Blockchain for native, smart contract games, which holders will use
            to explore methods for transferring and storing information, building and sustaining
            alternative forms of capital, and implementing a holistic version of digital ownership.
            This lets the project to set an industry standard for reliable, community-oriented
            platforms while simultaneously leveraging the advantages of a blockchain ecosystem,
            built on the framework of interconnected DAPPs (decentralized applications).{" "}

            Royal Protocol will power said ecosystem, which will include Royal Arcade games, an NFT
            Marketplace, a wallet app, and more. $ROY has a total supply of 6 billion tokens. At the
            time of writing, there are approximately 2.5 billion tokens in circulation. The value of
            $ROY is tied to its use as a utility token within the Royal Protocol Ecosystem and, as
            such, does not have reflections or deflationary tokenomics built into the contract.
            There is a potential for future burns moving forward. With a total supply of 6 million
            tokens, the governance token, $GROY, is the key to an interactive future for Royal
            Protocol, allowing users to understand their personal voting power, their allocated
            rewards for certain events, and a wide range of other features which will be unique to
            the Royal Protocol Ecosystem. Additional benefits of $GROY have yet to be released, but
            it plays an important role for large-scale involvement and potential partnerships.
            GameFi (Decentralized Game-based Finance) reconfigured traditional economic systems and
            financial structures.

            Supported by the ecosystem, digital gaming can become the bridge that allows users to
            connect and earn a variety of “incomes” simply by playing, streaming, watching, or
            collecting aspects of games which are powered by Royal Protocol. Royal Protocol fulfills
            its obligation to holders by rising above the security standards of the current market.
            The project will take every possible precaution to establish a new level of safety
            within a blockchain environment by utilizing tools such as the Royal Arcade
            Certification and carefully-selected teams of specialists to enable Royal Arcade audited
            contracts. Gaming evolution could not be complete without redefining what makes
            something safe and reliable. Currently, many gaming mechanics are specifically designed
            as unethical methods which are considered acceptable because there are no reliable
            alternatives. Users who are involved in online gaming frequently find themselves
            interacting with dark patterns, such as loot boxes, pay to skip, or artificial scarcity.
            It’s only through a re-conceptualization of how games can exist and interact through
            blockchain technology that Royal Protocol can shift the standard of accountability to
            empower and protect users. Royal Protocol looks to lower the cost of buying games,
            decrease risk and loss, increase financial rewards, add accessibility, protect user
            information, and openly present accurate data. Royal Protocol is many things but, most
            profoundly, it’s a software development company taking steps to redirect how online
            games and digital gaming can impact everyday life.
